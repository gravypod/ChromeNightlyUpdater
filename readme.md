======

A simple application to find, track, and download chrome snapshot builds.

I do not support these builds in any way I am in no way affiliated with google. 
These builds are meant for testing pourposes, expect errors.
Report problems experianced while runnning these to builds to google, not me.

TODO

1. Command line args to avoid using the GUI.
2. Show changelogs
